#+title: Josh Holbrook's GPL-compatible Free Software

* Hello
This repository contains my open source repositories that are licensed under
either the GPL or GPL-compatible licenses.

For my non-GPL open source software, check out
[[https://github.com/jfhbrook/public][my public repository]].

Each project should be well-documented and with relevant license files.
* Contents
** gshell.py
This is a straight port of GLib's gshell.c to Python. It is licensed under the
LGPL v2.1 or later, at your option.
** Cackledaemon
This is a project I wrote for managing my Emacs install on Windows 10. It
contains an org-based literate program that encodes a PowerShell module and
includes all of my notes and PROTIPS for running Emacs on Windows. It is
licensed under the GPL v3 or later, at your option.
** talks
These are slide decks I made for the NYC Emacs meetup. They are individually
licensed under GPL compatible licenses. Check the directories for more
information.
