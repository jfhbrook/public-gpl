** Cackledaemon
This is a project I wrote for managing my Emacs install on Windows 10. It
contains an org-based literate program that encodes a PowerShell module and
includes all of my notes and PROTIPS for running Emacs on Windows. It is
licensed under the GPL v3 or later, at your option.
** talks
These are slide decks I made for the NYC Emacs meetup. They are individually
licensed under GPL compatible licenses. Check the directories for more
information.
